#Lab 1: 
##Using EDA Playground

###Running Half Adder Code:

Using the code given was quite simple, all EDA playground requires is information on which system to emulate, 
and the top entity being used in the simulation

Below is the results when running the half adder design & testbench on EDAPlayground

### Running Multiplexer Code:

Similar to the half adder, the mux code also required minimal input from myself.

Below is the results when running the mux code.
